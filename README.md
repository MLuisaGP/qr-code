## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Some of the things I learned while making this project are the use of CSS variables.

```css
:root{
    --slate-900:#1F214F;
    --slate-500:#68778D;
    --slate-300:#D5E1EF;
    --white:#fff;
    --mobile-size: 375px;
    --desktop-size: 1440px;
}
p{
    color: var(--slate-500);
}
```


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills in translating Figma designs into functional websites. This project was my first experience following a Figma layout, and I realized the importance of precision and consistency in spacing, font sizes, and component structure. I also plan to deepen my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox, as well as improve my use of CSS variables for better code organization and reusability. These tools were really helpful in this project, and I want to refine my approach to using them more efficiently.
